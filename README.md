# AStar-Pathfinding
 
This repository contains a C++ implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm. A* is a popular algorithm used for finding the shortest path between two points on a grid or graph. This program is designed to work with grid-based environments and can be used in a variety of applications, such as game development, robotics, and route planning.

Key Features:

A* pathfinding algorithm implementation
Grid-based pathfinding on customizable grids
Visualization capabilities (if included)
Easily adaptable for various use cases
Usage:

Customize the grid, start, and goal points to suit your specific scenario.
Run the program to find the shortest path.
Optionally, visualize the path (if visualization is included).
Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to this A* pathfinding project. It's a valuable tool for solving pathfinding problems efficiently.
