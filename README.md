<h1>A* Pathfinding Algorithm in C++</h1>

<p>This C++ program implements the A* (A-star) pathfinding algorithm for finding the shortest path between two points on a grid. A* is widely used in various applications, such as game development, robotics, and route planning.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A* pathfinding algorithm implementation.</li>
  <li>Grid-based pathfinding with customizable grids.</li>
  <li>Text-based output displaying the path coordinates.</li>
  <li>Sample grid included for demonstration.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Clone or download this repository to your local machine.</li>
  <li>Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>g++ main.cpp -o pathfinding</code></pre>

<ol start="3">
  <li>Run the compiled program:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>./pathfinding</code></pre>

<p>The program will calculate and display the path coordinates, or it will indicate if no path is found.</p>

<p>Feel free to customize the grid, start, and goal points to suit your specific pathfinding problem.</p>

<h2>Sample Grid</h2>

<p>The program includes a sample grid for testing. You can modify this grid and set your own start and goal points in the <code>main</code> function to experiment with different scenarios.</p>

<p>For any questions or issues, please open an issue in this repository.</p>
